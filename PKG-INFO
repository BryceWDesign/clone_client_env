# Clone Client Env

This package is wrapper around logic of `clone_client` package. It has a gym-like API however **it's not** gym compatible. Use it to extend any proper gym environment.

Clone Client API package is accessible here:
https://github.com/clonerobotics/clone_client

Please get familiar with README there before using this package.

## Installation

Unfortunately, we do not provide PyPI releases just yet, but you can use this repository as an installation candidate using pip:

https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#examples

## Quick overview

```python
from clone_client_env import CloneEnv

robot = CloneEnv(hostname="clonepiext", timeout=0.0045, log_level = logging.ERROR)
```

`hostname` - name of the robot to connect to. The dafult should be up-to-date. Although you can change it to your own robot name.

`timeout` - how long to wait for a response. Default is `0.0045` (4.5ms). Making it smaller can affect the overall frequency due to too much dropped frames.

For detailed specification please contact us.

`log_level` - level of logs to show in the console. Default is `logging.ERROR`. Changing this might be useful for debugging.

```python
# Connect
robot.connect()

# Step
robot.step([...])

# Obs
obs = robot.get_obs()

# Reset
robot.reset([...])

# Close
robot.close()

```

Working example can be found in [example.py](/clone_client_env/example.py)

Please use it as reference.

Mind that calling `get_obs` right after `step` **can't** guarantee that the actions have been performed fully. Consider adding a pause between.
